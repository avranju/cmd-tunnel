# cmd-tunnel

This is a small utility that tunnels commands between terminals and forwards
stdout and stderr. I wrote this because I was tired of the Windows terminal
not supporting the affordances I'd become used to in Linux land with zsh. This
lets me be in zsh but run commands and such in a Windows terminal.
